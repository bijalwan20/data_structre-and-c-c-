/*  Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

              Example 1:
              Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
              Output: [1,2,3,5]

              Example 2:
              Input: head = [1], n = 1
              Output: []

              Example 3:
              Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
              Output: [1]
